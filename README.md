Seasons of code- Visionary project 2025
- Over the course of 4 weeks, I've learnt-
- How to implement certain foundational Python libraries such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
- Understanding the core theory behind how neural networks work and the practical application of buliding a simple neural network from scratch.
- Evaluating the model's performace by analysing accuracies of the training and testing data and comparing the impact of different optimisers.
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - building a cnn from scratch.
- Comparing the model's performace between ANN and CNN.
